In particular the Fault Level is a measure of the strength of a network. It is the amount of apparent power that the network can supply when a three-phase bolted to ground fault is applied at the point of connection. From these values an effective resistance and inductance can be calculated. Typical values of X/R ratios are in the range of 0.5 to 1.5, for distribution networks.

The mode aims to mimic a synchronous generator, and thereby has two more coefficients, two time constants τv and τf, which are used to calculate the virtual mass moment of inertia, J and integral gain K. The mode provides additional flexibility over the droop mode, in that real and imaginary power set points can be provided. Unlike the PQ mode these set points are more akin to biases, because the inverter will not necessarily output these powers. For example, the real power set point will only be reached if the VSG is connected to a swing supply with a fixed frequency. Moreover, an inverter in VSG mode may present with unwanted oscillatory behaviour similar to the hunting effect in synchronous generators.","category":"page"},{"location":"Classical_Controllers_VSG/","page":"Virtual Synchronous Generator","title":"Virtual Synchronous Generator","text":"(Image: )","category":"page"},{"location":"Classical_Controllers_VSG/","page":"Virtual Synchronous Generator","title":"Virtual Synchronous Generator","text":"Similar to the droop mode, if the user does not specify D_p and D_q, then they are automatically tuned based on the converter power rating and the network's maximum allowable frequency and voltage deviations, i.e. Δfmax and ΔEmax.

As shown before, it is connected to source 1 and source 2, but the entries have a negative sign. The negative sign indicates that the flow direction of the current is assumed to be negative. The sign of the entries is taken into account when constructing the DGLs, but has no influence on the subsequent current flow in the simulation. The matrix is antisymmetric, which means that we have a mirroring of the matrix along the main diagonal with the sign of the entries reversed.","category":"page"},{"location":"NodeConstructor_Application/","page":"The Nodeconstructor - Application","title":"The Nodeconstructor - Application","text":"In Julia, this matrix then looks like this:","category":"page"},{"location":"NodeConstructor_Application/","page":"The Nodeconstructor - Application","title":"The Nodeconstructor - Application","text":"CM = [ 0  0  1\n       0  0  2\n      -1 -2  0];","category":"page"},{"location":"NodeConstructor_Application/","page":"The Nodeconstructor - Application","title":"The Nodeconstructor - Application","text":"We now import the ElectricGrid package:","category":"page"},{"location":"NodeConstructor_Application/","page":"The Nodeconstructor - Application","title":"The Nodeconstructor - Application","text":"# Import the package\nusing ElectricGrid","category":"page"},{"location":"NodeConstructor_Application/","page":"The Nodeconstructor - Application","title":"The Nodeconstructor - Application","text":"<div style=\"padding: 1em; background-color: #f8d6da; border: 1px solid #f5c6cb; font-weight: bold;\">\n<p>The WebIO Jupyter extension was not detected.
