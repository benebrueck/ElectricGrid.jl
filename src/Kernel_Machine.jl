function series_Gxy(series, scale, npast, nfuture; decay = 1, qcflags = nothing, localdiff = 0, take2skipX = 0)

    #=
        Compute the past and the future Gram matrices, using the kernel set by set_kernel (defaults to Gaussian)
        
        Arguments:
        series: array or list. Each array is a time-contiguous block of data, 
        with as many rows as time samples and each column is a feature. NaN values are allowed and detected. 
        A list may be provided, in which case each list entry is a different data source. 
        Heterogenous data are supported, so each list entry can be of completely different type. 
        However, each list entry must have the same number of values.
        Each first-level list entry can itself be a second-level list instead of a unique array. 
        In that case, these second-level lists gather data acquired in different time-continuous blocks. 
        These blocks must be consistent across heterogenous data sources: at each time, 
        each data source must be acquired, even though some sensors may fail (NaN values).
        So, in order to enter a unique data source, but with multiple time blocks, 
        the syntax is to use a double list : [[data1, data2, ...]] . 
        
        There, the first-level list specifies a unique data source, and the second level list specifies the contiguous data blocks.
        Multiple sources and multiple blocks read: [[src1_block1, src1_block2], [src2_block1, src2_block2]. 
        Same-numbered blocks from different sources must be of the same length, but different blocks may have different lengths.

        scale: float, or list of floats. If a single float is provided it applies to all series. 
        A list of floats specifies a different scale for each data source.
         
        npast: take that consecutive number of samples for building an observed past. 
        If a single integer is provided it applies to all series. Different values can be provided 
        for different data sources (=each series). 
        It is assumed that data samples are measured at matching times for each data source, 
            hence the first causal state can only be computed after the-largest-npast values have been observed.
        
        nfuture: take that consecutive number of samples, just after the past samples, 
        for building an observed future. If a single integer is provided it applies to all series. 
        Similarly as for npast, the largest nfuture value sets the time of the last computable causal state.
        
        decay: ratio for the furthermost weight compared to the immediate past/future. 
        Defaults to 1 = no decay. If a single float is provided it applies to all series
        
        qcflags : quality control flags. <= 0 means invalid data. optional, but if present there must be one qcflag per sample
        
        localdiff: how to compute the differences between the sequences, pasts and futures. 
        The default is 0 = just take the difference. This assumes that what matters are the 
        series absolute values. localdiff = 1 removes the average (weigthed using decay) of 
        each sequence before taking their differences. This may be useful for eliminating a 
        slow drift due to the sensor itself, which should be removed from data. localdiff = 2 
        means that the "present" value is used as reference. This assumes that what matters 
        are relative variations around the "present" value. Warning: this gives equal importance 
        to all such variations. For example, a fluctuation of -3°C in summer (from ~25°C) is not 
        the same as a fluctuation of -3°C in winter (which may very well cross the freezing point).
        
        take2skipX : int, optional (default 0)
        performs a special kind of subsampling: two consecutive samples are retained, X samples are discarded, 
        then this (X+2) sequence repeats. This scheme is designed to preserve consecutive entries for building a shift operator while still allowing subsampling of very large series. The classic subsampling scheme (take one out of X) can also be applied a priori to the original series, but it is equivalent to a (bad) low-pass filtering. Then, the shift operator would be computed on consecutive entries of the subsampled series, hence at a different time scale. The take2skipX allows to still work on the original time scale. Both can be combined (after appropriate low-pass filtering).
        
    Returns:
        dpast, dfuture: two square matrices of size N, between each observed sequences of a past/future sample pairs.
        If lists are passed as arguments, each list entry is considered its own
        series object, with a matching scale. The data are then combined into
        a unique Gram matrix

        idxmap : N array of int
            Returns the indices of the valid (not NaN) and contiguous (past,future) pairs. For each returned row/col index of the dpast, dfuture matrices, the idxmap specifies what data in the original series that (past,future) reference pair refers to.

        Parameters
        ----------
        series : list of arrays
            list of contiguous data blocks
            
        npast : int
            take that consecutive number of samples for building an observed past. This must be an integer, 
                at least 1 value is needed (the present is part of the past)
            
        nfuture : int
            take that consecutive number of samples, just after the past samples, for building an observed future. 
            nfuture can be 0, in which case, the function only looks for valid pasts. combined with npast==1, the function 
            only looks for valid non-NaN values across all data sources
            
        skip_start : int, optional (default 1)
            number of data to mark as invalid at the beginning of each contiguous data block. 
            Useful to align heterogenous data with different npast/nfuture.
            
        skip_end : int, optional (default 1)
            number of data to mark as invalid at the end of each contiguous data block. 
            Useful to align heterogenous data with different npast/nfuture.
            
        qcflags : list of arrays, optional
            quality control flags. <= 0 means invalid data. optional, but if present there must be one qcflag per sample
            
        take2skipX : int, optional (default 0)
            performs a special kind of subsampling: two consecutive samples are retained, X samples are discarded, 
            then this (X+2) sequence repeats. This scheme is designed to preserve consecutive entries for building 
            a shift operator while still allowing subsampling of very large series. The classic subsampling scheme 
            (take one out of X) can also be applied a priori to the original series, but it is equivalent to a (bad) 
            low-pass filtering. Then, the shift operator would be computed on consecutive entries of the subsampled 
            series, hence at a different time scale. The take2skipX allows to still work on the original time scale. 
            Both can be combined (after appropriate low-pass filtering).

        Returns
        -------
        concat_idx_map: (N,) array of int
            Returns the indices of the valid entries, but stacking all series passed as argument in a single series. 
            The indices refer to valid entries in that global stacked array. Hence, discontiguous data blocks generate 
            invalid entries in the global stacked array.

    """
    Compute a similarity matrix for the embedded causal states, seen as distributions P(Y|X), 
    using the conditional mean embedding.

    Arguments:
        Gx: a similarity matrix of pasts X. Gx[i,j] = kernel_X(x_i, x_j) with kernel_X a reproducing kernel for X.
        Gy: a similarity matrix of futures Y.
        ϵ: amount of regularization. The theory requires a regularizer and shows that the regularized 
        estimator is consistent in the limit of N -> infinity. In practice, using a too small regularizer 
        may cause divergence, too large causes innaccuracies.
        normalize: whether to renormalize the returned similarity matrix, so that each entry along the 
        diagonal is 1. See below.
        return_embedder: whether to return an embedder object for new, unknown data. Default is False
        
    Returns:

        Gs: A similarity matrix between each causal states. Entries Gs[i,j] can be seen as inner products 
        between states S_i and S_j. 
        With normalized kernels, such as used in series_Gxy, then state vectors should also be normalized. 
        Also, theoretically, that matrix should be positive definite. In practice, numerical innacuracies 
        and estimating from finite samples may destroy both previous properties. Renormalization is performed 
        by default, but if positive definiteness issues happens, try using a larger regularizer.

        TODO: tests if this is really necessary for the embedder,
        knowing the distributions will be normalized later on.
        Tests: actually, this impacts a bit the numerical resolution

        option 1 : all the weights on the left side:
        embedder /= Gs.diagonal()[:,None]
        if applied to Gs, this would yield 1s on the diagonal
