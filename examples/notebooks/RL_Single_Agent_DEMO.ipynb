    " - define reward function,\n",
    " - define featurize function,\n",
    " - training a single RL agent.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook a reinforcement learning agent is trained to control the current flowing through an inductor.\n",
    "It will be shown for an easy case how the agent can learn and be applied to an electrical power grid simulated with de JEG package.\n",
